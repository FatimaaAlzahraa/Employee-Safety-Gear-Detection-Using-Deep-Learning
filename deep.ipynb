    "### 1. Employee Safety Gear Detection Using MobileNetV2\n",
    "- In many industrial environments, ensuring that employees adhere to safety protocols by wearing the appropriate safety gear is essential to preventing workplace accidents and maintaining regulatory compliance. Personal protective equipment (PPE), such as helmets and safety vests, is crucial in minimizing risks. However, manual supervision of employee safety compliance can be error-prone and inefficient, especially in large-scale operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This project aims to develop an automated deep learning model that can detect whether employees are wearing appropriate safety gear—specifically, helmets and safety vests—before commencing work. By leveraging image recognition techniques, the model can provide a real-time solution for monitoring workplace safety."
